I am a postdoctoral fellow of the Communicating Causality project at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Daniel Lassiter. 

During the 2025/26 academic year I will be Fulbright Scholar at the New York University philosophy department,  supervised by Kit Fine.

At present I am working on modality, philosophical logic, conditionals, and causality.
