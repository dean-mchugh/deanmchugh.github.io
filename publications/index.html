I propose that R is a reason why P just in case ‘P because R’ is true. I show that this equivalence predicts a wide range of interesting properties of explanatory reasons, including the difference between reasons and causes, the synonymy of ‘the reason is that R’ and ‘the reason is because R’, the subjective character of reasons, and the fact that reasons can be possessed (as in ‘I have a reason why I did it’) but causes cannot.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chatainmchugh2025thepartsofonly" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Parts of <i>Only</i>: Effects of Mereology in the Semantics of <i>Only</i> </div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://kenyc.github.io" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Keny Chatain</a> and Dean McHugh </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Semantics and Linguistic Theory</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Traditionally, <i>only</i> is thought to negate non-weaker alternatives. Kratzer’s (1989) still life example, presented more than thirty years ago, challenges this purely logical approach to the semantics of <i>only</i>, appearing to show that the constitution of objects matters to what <i>only</i> negates. This paper reexamines Kratzer’s example in the light of later developments in the literature on <i>only</i>. We discuss four types of responses: (i) uphold the traditional view of <i>only</i> supplemented by lexical postulates (van Rooij 2005), (ii) adopt an innocent exclusion semantics for <i>only</i> (Fox 2007), (iii) replace entailment in the meaning of <i>only</i> with ‘lumping’, a variant of entailment defined in terms of situation semantics (von Fintel 1997, Bonomi &amp; Casalegno 1993, Kadmon 2001), (iv) following Kratzer’s (1989) suggestion, appeal to a general no-overlap constraint on counting domains. We show that all approaches but (iv) face empirical challenges. Despite some loose ends, we favour (iv) in the comparison, as it faces no clear empirical challenges, though significant work remains to be done.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mchugh2025disjunctionsofuniversalmodals" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Disjunctions of Universal Modals and Conditionals</div> <div class="author"> Dean McHugh </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The Connectives in Logic and Language</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-86054-6_4" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper is concerned with disjunctions of universal modals, such as ‘You have to clean your room or you have to walk the dog’, and disjunctions of conditionals, such as ‘If Alice dances, Charlie will dance, or if Bob dances, Charlie will dance’. We aim to provide a uniform account of their surprising behaviour. Our proposal combines three independently attested components. Firstly, disjunction’s dynamic effect, familiar from presupposition projection: when we evaluate a disjunction A ∨B, we typically interpret B assuming the negation of A, and optionally, also interpret A assuming the negation of B. Secondly, the fact that disjunctions often receive a conjunctive interpretation, familiar from free choice phenomena. Thirdly, that modal bases are restricted to local contexts, what Mandelkern has called ‘bounded modality’.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mchughklochowicz2024newexperimentalevidence" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">New Experimental Evidence Against the Similarity Approach to Conditionals</div> <div class="author"> Dean McHugh and <a href="https://www.tklochowicz.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tomasz Klochowicz</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Semantics and Linguistic Theory</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3765/e03b4r46" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The similarity approach to conditionals (Stalnaker 1968; Lewis 1973) predicts Reciprocity to be valid: whenever A &gt; B, B &gt; A and A &gt; C are true, B &gt; C is true too (where A &gt; B denotes if A would B).

The properties are, firstly, their comparative nature: interpreting <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i> involves comparing what would happen in the presence of the cause (a positive condition) with what would happen in the absence of the cause (a negative condition). Secondly, there is an asymmetry in logical strength between the two conditions: the positive condition involves a universal modal while the negative condition involves an existential modal. Thirdly, the positive and negative conditions have the same modal base, i.e. are interpreted while assuming the same set of background facts. Despite their apparent dissimilarity, we show that these three properties are predicted by a single operation: exhaustification. The comparative nature of <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i> follows from the comparative nature of exhaustification, which compares a sentence with its alternatives. The asymmetry in strength arises because exhaustification negates alternatives: given the duality between universal and existential quantification, negation flips a necessity modal into a possibility modal, producing the observed strength asymmetry. Finally, the positive and negative condition have the same modal base since, rather <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i> having two modals in their semantics—one for the positive condition and one for the negative condition—their semantics contains a single modal which is copied by exhaustification. We conclude by showing that this exhaustification operator violates Economy constraints, suggesting that it is not subject to licensing conditions but part of lexical semantics of <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mchugh2023causationandmodality" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Causation and Modality: Models and Meanings</div> <div class="author"> Dean McHugh </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>University of Amsterdam</em>, 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This thesis aims to answer two questions about causal claims (such as sentences containing <i>cause</i> or <i>because</i>). Firstly, the modelling question: what kind of information do we use when we judge that a causal claim holds? Secondly, the meaning question: under what conditions do we judge that a causal claim is true? Our answer to the modelling question is that a causal model must contain time, part–whole structure, and nomic possibility. The model represents scenarios as extended in time, with each moment in time having a mereological structure (the mereological structure tell us, for example, that the state of Amsterdam is part the state of the Netherlands). The notion of nomic possibility specifies which worlds are nomically possible and which worlds are nomically impossible; in other words, which worlds satisfy the laws and which do not. In addition, the model must also contain two language-related components. For each sentence, the model must tell us what parts of the world it is about, and in which worlds the sentence is true. We show that this modelling framework is strictly more general than a popular alternative, that of structural causal models. Every structural causal model can be represented into our framework, and therefore every scenario that structural causal models can represent our framework can represent too. However, the converse does not hold. There are some scenarios that our proposed model can represent which structural causal models cannot. We use these components to analyse how people construct hypothetical alternatives to reality. For it is commonly thought that the truth of a causal claim depends not only on what goes on in the actual world, but on what happens in some hypothetical scenarios as well. For example, when we evaluate Alice missed her flight because she got stuck in traffic we imagine scenarios where she is stuck in traffic and scenarios where she is not, and compare what happens in each. We then analyse the semantics of <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i> in terms of two relations: sufficiency and production. The meaning of <i>cause</i> and <i>because</i> is a blend of these relations: <i>C cause E</i> and <i>E because C</i> are true just in case <i>C</i> is true, and <i>C</i> is sufficient to produce <i>E</i> but <i>C</i>’s negation is not.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mchugh2022aboutnessandmodality" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Aboutness and modality</div> <div class="author"> Dean McHugh </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proceedings of the 23rd Amsterdam Colloquium</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.21942/uva.21739718" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this paper I would like to offer a new framework for hypothetical reasoning, with the goal of predicting what scenarios we consider when we interpret a conditional or causal claim (such as a sentence containing the word <i>because</i>). The idea is that when we interpret a conditional or causal claim, we identify a part of the world to change and imagine changing that. Sentences are about parts of the world: when we interpret a conditional antecedent or because clause, we allow the part of the world it is about to vary. This expands our modal horizons, which we restrict to those scenarios where the sentence we are asked to imagine true is indeed true. To evaluate a whole conditional or causal claim we look to the possible futures after this change. My main evidence for this approach is that it gives just the right range of hypothetical scenarios to account for how we interpret both conditionals and causal claims. Some approaches (such as Stalnaker and Lewis’s semantics of conditionals based on similarity, and Kratzer’s premise semantics) consider too few scenarios, while others (such as Fine’s 2012 truthmaker semantics of conditionals) consider too many. The present approach inhabits a Goldilock’s zone between these extremes: not too restrictive, not too permissive, but just right.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="izdebski2021pragmatic" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A pragmatic approach to estimating average treatment effects from EHR data: the effect of prone positioning on mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients</div> <div class="author"> Adam Izdebski, Patrick J.
